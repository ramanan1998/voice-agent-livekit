LiveKit AI Voice Agent for Inbound Calls

This agent handles inbound SIP calls from Vobiz using:
- Deepgram for Speech-to-Text (STT)
- OpenAI for Text-to-Speech (TTS) and LLM
- Automatic greeting when caller connects

The agent is automatically spawned when an inbound call arrives,
matched by dispatch rules configured in LiveKit.
